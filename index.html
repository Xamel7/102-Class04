    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>It was a pretty cool game.If you like story driven games.Every now and again I enjoy great told story but this was lacking in a few areas.Like the story... man, it really drags the game down. The characters are cookie-cutter anime tropes, the plot is extremely by-the-numbers but worst of all it's soooo loooong. I just want to make it to the end of the game but it's just constant cutscenes;where there saying their stupid catchphrases and of it has any impact on me in the least.But on the other hand, thhe gameplay is visaully captivating and art styles are seriouly next level. I'll give it a  5.5/10.</p>
